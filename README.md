## Summary
Gutted the previous assignment in favour of a *Now Playing* page for a movie theatre.

The goal for the site is entirely focused on advertising future/current film screenings (half the nav bar is dedicated to a list of films). Cards are the easiest way to do this because summaries are brief and are usually more appealing to scroll through.

## Comments (removed from the html and css files)

- Struggled with adjusting hover effects so they wouldn't impact the rest of the page (the pastel ticket on the nav bar being the most annoying)
- Built the nav bar from scratch using both grid and flex. Went much better than last assignment.
- But nav bar still loses it around the 430px-ish mark.
- Couldn't figure out how to lock the hamburger menu icon down since it flits back-and-forth while hovered on. Didn't work in nor out of the nav bar grid.
- After deployment on GH Pages, ticket svg on the nav bar does not appear, but it still appears locally
  - tried changing the svg, adjusting HTML, and made sure mask-image was supported
